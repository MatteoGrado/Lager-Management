# Description:
The PHP-Lager-Management-System means in English PHP-Storage-Management-System. The short call for this is PHP-LMS for the Germans and for the English PHP-SMS.
For this description I use the German one.
The LMS is a project what I do in my training. I'm a trainee in the area of Software Development and Software Engeneering. My main language is Java but I don't like it. :)
